2.0.4 > 2.1.0
=============

* Add new webapp skeleton for creating non-cms based web applications on Preside
* Added a post install concept for skeletons

0.6.0 > 2.0.4
=============

* Updated skeleton for `preside new site` command to use forgebox packages (in readiness for multiple skeleton options and simplifying the build process)
* Use a hires icon for `preside start` servers on Linux machines (now that we will have working AppIndicators in Linux with CommandBox)
* Do not prompt to download preside when we find preside already located in the webroot of the project when running `preside start` for the first time
